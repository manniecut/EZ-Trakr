## How to Use It
You will need valid tracking information to use it. Luckily I have a tracking number handy for you:
- 8342704440 for carrier DHL

* Input your tracking information into the form
* Your item will be added to the list
* The list stays on your PC's local storage
* The storage automatically saves and loads
* You can press the refresh button to get the latest updates
* The list also auto updates when your page refreshes
* You can remove a list item when you are done with it
* The app also displays the city that your package is in
